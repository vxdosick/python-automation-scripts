## Python Automation Scripts

This repository contains a collection of small Python automation projects aimed at solving everyday tasks and demonstrating practical Python skills.

Each project is contained in its own folder with a separate README.md explaining its purpose, usage, and dependencies.

## Projects Included
file_organizer – Organizes files in a folder into categories (images, documents, videos, audio, archives, others) based on file extensions.

(future projects can be added here: e.g., web scraper, log cleaner, backup scripts, etc.)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vxdosick/python-automation-scripts.git
cd python-automation-scripts
```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd file_organizer
```
3. Run the script
```bash
python file_organizer.py
```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions (e.g., provide the folder path to organize).

## Features
Fully written in Python 3
Uses standard libraries only (os, pathlib, shutil)
Modular structure — each automation task is isolated in its own folder
Easy to expand with new automation 

## Goals of This Repository
Showcase practical Python automation skills
Provide ready-to-use tools for everyday tasks
Demonstrate ability to structure, write, and maintain multiple Python projects in one repository

## Future Plans
Add web scraping scripts
Add API data fetchers
Add log or file cleaning tools
